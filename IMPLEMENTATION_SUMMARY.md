# PDF CV Improvements Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. PDF Margin Improvements
- Added `padding-bottom: 40px` to the `body` element in the generated HTML
- Added `padding-bottom: 40px` to `.cv-main` class
- This ensures content doesn't reach the edge of the page
- The "Powered by LandingVille" watermark remains outside the content margins as requested

### 2. Multiple Languages per Project
Previously, only one language was displayed per project (e.g., "TypeScript").

Now:
- Added `getRepoLanguages()` method to `csv.service.ts` to fetch all languages for a repository
- Modified the project fetching logic to call the GitHub API's `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/languages` endpoint for each project
- All languages are now displayed as styled chips (e.g., "TypeScript", "HTML", "CSS")
- Added new CSS classes:
  - `.project-languages` - container for language chips
  - `.project-language` - individual language chip styling with blue background (#e8f4f8)

### 3. Topics/Chips Display
- Topics from GitHub repositories are now displayed below the language stack
- Added new CSS classes:
  - `.project-topics` - container for topic chips
  - `.project-topic` - individual topic chip styling with light blue background (#f1f8ff) and border

### 4. Username, Name, and Pronouns Display
Changed from:
```
nombre (e.g., "octocat")
USER
```

To:
```
@username (e.g., "@octocat")
Name (Pronouns) (e.g., "The Octocat")
```

Changes:
- Modified sidebar to display `@${user.username}` as the main heading
- Added `name` and `pronouns` fields to user data
- Display format: `Name (Pronouns)` if both are available, just `Name` if only name is available
- Updated both `landing.component.ts` and `demo-profile.component.ts`

## Files Modified

1. **src/app/csv.service.ts**
   - Added `getRepoLanguages()` method

2. **src/app/landing/landing.component.ts**
   - Added imports for `of`, `map`, `catchError` from rxjs
   - Updated user data structure to include `name` and `pronouns`
   - Modified project fetching to enrich projects with all languages and topics
   - Updated CSS in `generateCVHtml()` to add margins and new chip styles
   - Updated HTML template to show @username, name, pronouns, all languages, and topics

3. **src/app/demo-profile/demo-profile.component.ts**
   - Added `name` and `pronouns` to demo user data
   - Updated demo projects to include `languages` array and `topics` array
   - Updated CSS in `generateCVHtml()` to match landing component
   - Updated HTML template to match landing component

## Technical Implementation Details

### Language Fetching Strategy
- Uses `forkJoin` to fetch languages for all top projects in parallel
- Falls back to single language if API call fails
- Filters out forked repositories
- Sorts by stargazers_count, then by updated_at date
- Limits to top 10 projects

### Styling Approach
- Language chips: Blue background (#e8f4f8) with darker blue text (#0366d6)
- Topic chips: Light blue background (#f1f8ff) with blue border (#c8e1ff) and rounded corners
- Both use flex layout with wrap for responsive display
- Font size 10px for compact display in PDF

## Testing
- Build completes successfully
- No TypeScript errors introduced
- Demo profile page loads correctly
- All user fields display properly
