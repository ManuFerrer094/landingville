# Organization Page 404 Fix - Quick Reference

## Problem
```
User visits: https://landingville.netlify.app/organization/microsoft
    ↓
Netlify server looks for physical file: /organization/microsoft
    ↓
❌ 404 Not Found
```

## Solution

### Part 1: Server-Side Fix (Netlify _redirects)
```
User visits: https://landingville.netlify.app/organization/microsoft
    ↓
Netlify reads _redirects file
    ↓
Redirect rule: /*  →  /index.html  (200)
    ↓
✅ Serves index.html with Angular app
    ↓
Angular Router takes over and loads OrganizationComponent
```

### Part 2: Client-Side Fix (Angular Router)

**Before (❌ Wrong):**
```typescript
// home.component.ts
window.location.href = `/organization/${orgName}`;
```
- Causes full page reload
- Loses application state
- Slower user experience

**After (✅ Correct):**
```typescript
// home.component.ts
this.router.navigate(['/organization', orgName]);
```
- Uses Angular's client-side routing
- No page reload
- Maintains application state
- Faster navigation

## Files Changed

1. **src/_redirects** (NEW)
   ```
   /*    /index.html   200
   ```

2. **angular.json**
   ```json
   "assets": [
     "src/favicon.ico",
     "src/assets",
     "src/_redirects"  // ← Added this
   ]
   ```

3. **src/app/home/home.component.ts**
   ```typescript
   import { Router } from '@angular/router';  // ← Added import
   
   constructor(
     private csvService: CsvService,
     private i18nService: I18nService,
     private router: Router  // ← Injected Router
   ) { }
   
   // Changed navigation method
   this.router.navigate(['/organization', orgName]);  // ← New
   ```

## Test URLs

After deploying to Netlify, these should all work:

1. ✅ `https://landingville.netlify.app/organization/microsoft`
2. ✅ `https://landingville.netlify.app/organization/google`
3. ✅ `https://landingville.netlify.app/organization/facebook`
4. ✅ `https://landingville.netlify.app/organization/angular`

## Why This Works

**The _redirects file** ensures that when someone visits a URL like `/organization/microsoft`, Netlify serves the `index.html` file instead of returning a 404. This allows Angular to initialize and handle the routing.

**The Router service** ensures that navigation within the app uses Angular's client-side routing, providing a smooth single-page application experience without full page reloads.

Together, these changes make the organization pages accessible both:
- Via direct URL navigation (typing in browser or bookmarks)
- Via in-app navigation (clicking links or search)
