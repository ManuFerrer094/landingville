# Implementation Summary - Organization Feature

## What Was Implemented

This pull request implements two major features:
1. **Removal of PDF watermarks** from exported CV/profiles
2. **Complete GitHub Organizations support** with rich visualizations

---

## 1. PDF Watermark Removal ✅

### Before:
PDFs had visible watermarks:
- "LandingVille" in the bottom-right corner
- "Powered by LandingVille" centered at the bottom

### After:
- Clean PDFs without any watermarks
- Professional output ready for distribution
- No branding text on exported documents

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/landing/landing.component.ts`

## 2. GitHub Organizations Page ✅

### New Features

#### Organization Profile Header
Displays:
- Organization avatar/logo
- Organization name and description
- Key statistics (members, repositories, location)
- Social links (website, Twitter)

#### Popular Repositories Section
Shows top 6 most starred repositories with:
- Repository name (clickable link)
- Description
- Programming language (with color indicator)
- Star count, fork count
- Topics/tags

#### Repositories & Commit Activity
Displays up to 10 repositories with:
- Full repository details
- **Visual commit activity graph** (last 26 weeks)
- Total commits count
- Last week's commits
- Stars, forks, and watchers counts

#### Members Section
- Grid display of organization members
- Shows first 30 members with avatars
- Links to member profiles
- Indicator for additional members

#### Links of Interest
Quick access buttons to:
- Organization Home
- All Repositories
- All Members
- Projects
- Teams
- Packages
- Discussions

### Supported Organization URLs

The system now recognizes organization URLs like:
- `https://github.com/turing-challenge`
- `https://github.com/facebook`
- `https://github.com/google`
- `https://github.com/microsoft`
- `https://github.com/angular`

When an organization URL is entered in the home page search:
1. System detects it's an organization (not a repository)
2. Redirects to `/organization/{orgName}`
3. Loads all organization data
4. Displays comprehensive organization profile
