# Changes Summary: PDF Profile Download with Watermark and Projects Table

## Overview
Modified the profile download functionality to generate PDF files instead of HTML files, with a LandingVille watermark and a projects table showing the user's repositories.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- **jspdf**: Library for PDF generation
- **html2canvas**: Library for converting HTML to canvas/image for PDF embedding
- **@types/jspdf**: TypeScript types for jspdf

### 2. Assets Created
- **src/assets/landingville-logo.svg**: Created LandingVille logo in SVG format with gradient styling

### 3. Component Updates

#### landing.component.ts
- Added imports for jsPDF, html2canvas, and HttpClient
- Added `userProjects` property to store fetched GitHub repositories
- Updated `startStatsAnimation()` to fetch and store user projects (top 10 repositories sorted by stars)
- Replaced `downloadCV()` method to:
  - Generate HTML content using the existing `generateCVHtml()` method
  - Render HTML to canvas using html2canvas
  - Convert canvas to PDF using jsPDF
  - Add "LandingVille" watermark on all pages
  - Save as PDF file (e.g., `CV_username.pdf`)
- Updated `generateCVHtml()` to include:
  - CSS styles for projects table
  - Projects section with a table showing:
    - Project name
    - Description
    - Primary language
    - Star count

#### demo-profile.component.ts
- Added imports for jsPDF, html2canvas, and HttpClient
- Added `demoProjects` property with sample project data for demonstration
- Updated `downloadCV()` method (same as landing component)
- Updated `generateCVHtml()` to include projects table (same structure as landing component)

## Features Implemented

### PDF Generation
- Profile is now downloaded as a PDF file instead of HTML
- Multi-page support: Content automatically spans multiple pages if needed
- High-quality rendering with 2x scale for crisp text and images

### Watermark
- "LandingVille" text watermark in bottom-right corner of each page
- "Powered by LandingVille" centered watermark at bottom of each page
- Watermarks use subtle gray colors to not interfere with content

### Projects Table
- Displays user's GitHub repositories in a professional table format
- Shows up to 10 projects sorted by star count
- Columns: Name, Description, Language, Stars
- Styled with alternating row colors for better readability
- Header with brand colors (#667eea)

## Technical Details

### PDF Generation Process
1. Generate HTML content with all profile information and projects table
2. Create a temporary DOM element to render the HTML
3. Use html2canvas to convert the rendered HTML to a canvas
4. Calculate page dimensions and split content across multiple PDF pages if needed
5. Add watermarks to all pages
6. Save and download the PDF file
7. Clean up temporary DOM elements

### Data Flow
- **landing.component.ts**: Fetches real user data from GitHub API
- **demo-profile.component.ts**: Uses hardcoded demo data for demonstration

## Backward Compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Only the download format changed (from HTML to PDF)
- All other features remain unchanged

## Notes
- Build completed successfully
- Pre-existing test failures are unrelated to these changes (missing test module imports)
- Bundle size increased due to PDF generation libraries (expected)
